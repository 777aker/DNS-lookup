# DNS-lookup
This is a c program for operating systems that implements any number of threads to resolve ip addresses and server lookups. Practices avoiding deadlocks, race conditions, synchronization, threading, mutual exclusion, semaphores. It's an efficient DNS I wrote. I made everything but util.c, util.h, and the input files. util only contains one function that converts from address to ip.
