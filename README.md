# DNS-lookup
This is a c program for operating systems that implements any number of threads made to resolve ip addresses and server lookups. Practices avoiding deadlocks, race conditions, synchronization, threading. It's basically an efficient DNS I wrote. I made everything but util.c, util.h, and the input files. util only contains one function that converts from address to ip.
